# Adopt a pet

This repository is a demonstration of using objects and rendering them to a webpage using DOM Manipulation.

## Progress so far

- We have a default set of data (`data.js`)
- We render that data to the page (`script.js`)
- We have pseudocode for the process for adding new pets (`addPet.js`)

## Next steps

- Add an HTML form to add a pet
- Write JavaScript to collect that data from the HTML on a button click
- Write JavaScript logic to add a pet to the `dataObject` in `data.js`
